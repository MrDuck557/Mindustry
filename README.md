Standard Mindustry avaliable at https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry

This version removes the fps cap, so you can enjoy god boosted stuff without being limited to 60 shots per second.
Due to the nature of item transfer, DO NOT put an item source next to an item void. Doing so will likely freeze your game.

Compiled version already avaliable [here](https://github.com/MrDuck557/MindustryFPSUncapped/blob/master/FPSBegone126.1.jar)
